# todo 

- add optional DJ role (if specified, only that role can use commands)
  - if DJ role is not specified, everyone can use commands
  - if DJ role is specified, give admins capability to specify which commands only DJ's can use and which commands everyone can use

- migrate from local filesystem to directly streaming from youtube (if i can figure out how to not get ratelimited)

- (maybe) make a c++ program that'll guide you through each step of getting this to run

# in progress

- change libraries from ytdl to use [youtube-stream-url](https://www.npmjs.com/package/youtube-stream-url)

# finished



# cancelled + reason

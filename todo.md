# todo 

- add optional DJ role (if specified, only that role can use commands)
  - if DJ role is not specified, everyone can use commands
  - if DJ role is specified, give admins capability to specify which commands only DJ's can use and which commands everyone can use

- migrate from local filesystem to directly streaming from youtube (if i can figure out how to not get ratelimited)

# in progress

- change libraries from ytdl to whatever [SpaceAce](https://github.com/The0n1y5pace4ce) ends up recommending as he said that ytdl is prone to bugs (waiting for a response from him in discord)

# finished



# cancelled + reason
